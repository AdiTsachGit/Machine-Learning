Introduction to machine learning
CS-233 / 6 cr√©dits

Enseignant(s): Fua Pascal, Salzmann Mathieu

Langue: Anglais

Summary

Machine learning and data analysis are becoming increasingly central in many sciences and applications. In this course, fundamental principles and methods of machine learning will be introduced, analyzed and practically implemented.

Content

Introduction: General concepts, data representation, basic optimization.
Linear methods: Linear regression, least-square classification, logistic regression, linear SVMs.
Nonlinear methods: Polynomial regression, kernel methods, K nearest neighbors
Deep learning: Multi-layer perceptron, CNNs.
Unsupervised learning: Dimensionality reduction, clustering.
Learning Prerequisites

REQUIRED COURSES

Linear Algebra

IMPORTANT CONCEPTS TO START THE COURSE

Basic linear algebra (matrix/vector multiplications, systems of linear equations, SVD)
Multivariate calculus (derivatives w.r.t. vector and matrix variables)
Basic programming skills (labs will use Python).
Learning Outcomes

By the end of the course, the student must be able to:

Define the following basic machine learning problems : regression, classification, clustering, dimensionality reduction
Explain the main differences between them
Derive the formulation of these machine learning models
Assess / Evaluate the main trade-offs such as overfitting, and computational cost vs accuracy
Implement machine learning methods on real-wolrd problems, and rigorously evaluate their performance using cross-validation
